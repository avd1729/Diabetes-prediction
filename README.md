# Regression-MLP

Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs):
----------------------------------------------

Multi-layer perceptrons, also known as feedforward neural networks, are a class of artificial neural networks that consist of multiple layers of interconnected artificial neurons or units. MLPs are widely used for various tasks such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition.

Here's a breakdown of the components and concepts in MLPs:

1. Input Layer: The first layer of an MLP receives input data, which could be numerical, categorical, or any other form of structured data.

2. Hidden Layers: MLPs can have one or more hidden layers sandwiched between the input and output layers. Each hidden layer consists of multiple neurons that perform computations on the input data.

3. Neurons: Neurons, also known as nodes or units, are the basic computational units in an MLP. Each neuron takes a weighted sum of its inputs, applies an activation function, and produces an output.

4. Weights and Biases: The connections between neurons in different layers have associated weights and biases. These parameters are learned during the training process to optimize the network's performance.

5. Activation Function: The activation function introduces non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn complex patterns and make non-linear predictions. Common activation functions include sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and tanh.

6. Forward Propagation: During the forward propagation step, the input data is fed through the network layer by layer, and the outputs of each layer are calculated using the weights and biases.

7. Backpropagation: Backpropagation is used to update the weights and biases in the network by propagating the error gradients backward from the output layer to the input layer. This process minimizes the difference between the predicted output and the desired output.

8. Training: MLPs are typically trained using optimization algorithms such as gradient descent or its variants. The training involves iteratively adjusting the weights and biases to minimize the network's loss or error function.

Comparison with Traditional ML Algorithms:
-------------------------------------------

MLPs differ from traditional machine learning algorithms in several ways:

1. Non-linearity: MLPs can learn non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs, thanks to the activation functions and multiple layers. Traditional ML algorithms, such as linear regression or logistic regression, are limited to linear relationships.

2. Feature Engineering: Traditional ML algorithms often require manual feature engineering, where domain knowledge is used to select or transform relevant features. MLPs can automatically learn relevant features from raw data, reducing the need for explicit feature engineering.

3. Representation Learning: MLPs, especially deep neural networks with many layers, can learn hierarchical representations of data. This ability allows them to capture complex patterns and dependencies in the data, making them suitable for tasks like image recognition or natural language processing.

4. Large Data and Compute Requirements: MLPs tend to require larger amounts of labeled training data to generalize effectively. They also benefit from significant computational resources for training, especially when dealing with large-scale networks.

5. Interpretability: Traditional ML algorithms often provide interpretable models, allowing users to understand the reasoning behind predictions. In contrast, MLPs, particularly deep neural networks, are considered black box models due to their complexity, making it challenging to interpret their decision-making process.

6. Generalization and Robustness: Traditional ML algorithms may generalize well with limited training data but could struggle with complex tasks. MLPs, when properly regularized and trained on large datasets, can achieve high generalization and robustness, even for complex problems.

It's worth noting that MLPs are just one type of neural network architecture, and there are other architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs
